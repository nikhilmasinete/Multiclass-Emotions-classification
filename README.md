# EmotionClassification


**Trained a  multiclass  classifier for classifying emotions into 6 categories. The dataset used for this is emotions dataset from huggingface's dataset library**


# Further Improvements that can be done for this project


1.   Minority classes can be oversampled by adding new data or by augmenting using paraphrase generative models.

2.   Different encoder type tranformers like RoBerta, Bert can be trained and benchmarked.

3.   Hypermaters can be tuned using optuna for further optimization.
